        'Salt of the earth kind of stuff.',
        'Not safe for drinking, deep brine is thought to be water from the Slime Sea that has been filtered by the subterranean coral below Rainbow Island. It is significantly denser than fresh water and loaded with salt.'
    ],
    'diamond': [
        'Very strange, but even more valuable.',
        'Even in the dark, these diamonds seem to shine as if light is passing through them. Strange diamonds are highly valued for their use in a variety of warp tech processes. Being almost impossibly dense and intricate in their composition, a strange diamond can reflect light within itself so profoundly that it actually bends time.\nStrange diamonds are most often found in caves and other dark places, as if the natural world wants to keep their brilliance all to itself.'
    ],
    'drift': [
        'Drifting away on the wind.',
        'Drift crystals form inside cyclones as earth and debris are whirled together at incredible speeds. Once ejected from the turbulent winds, drift crystals float gently to the ground, and are likely very dizzy.'
    ],
    'fossil': [
        'If history could smile, it would look like this.',
        'Prized for the ancient minerals they contain, slime fossils are like nature capturing a moment in time. Specifically, that moment seems to be when a great avalanche or mudslide occurred and a slime was totally cool with it.'
    ],
    'glass': [
        'When the sky welds the earth.',
        'Storm Glass is formed when lightning strikes the ground and melts rock in an instant. Not only does storm glass make a surprisingly durable building material, but it adds a heavenly pop of color!'
    ],
    'honey': [
        'Tastes great in tea or in shameful handfuls when no one is looking.',
        'All the rich pollens and sweet nectars found in the diverse biomes of the Far, Far Range combine in a beautiful alchemy to form some of the most delicious honey in the galaxy.\nWild honey is a staple of rancher life; a dollop of it makes just about any food taste better, and it provides a natural boost of energy to get through a tough day of wrangling slimes. '
    ],
    'jelly': [
        'It\'s both solid and squishy at the same time.',
        'Jellystone is a semi-hardened mixture of minerals and slime, possibly resulting from plorts sinking back to into the earth below. Because of its solid texture, it\'s a favorite stone for sculptors.'

    'lava': [
        'A survey on the state of this matter answered \'undecided\'.',
        'Neither a solid or a liquid, lava dust seems to be something in between, having the characteristics of both. It is believed to be a mixture of magma and slime, though this has never been proven. And despite its name, lava dust is only warm to the touch.'

    'mote': [
        'A scintillating speck of storm.',

        'This stuff is pre-pre-prehistoric.',
        'Found deep below the surface of the Rainbow Island\'s quarries and magma fields, primordy oil is an ancient substance containing a wide array of organic compounds, making it perfect as a base for many Slime Science creations.'

    'radiant': [
        'The awesome power of a rainbow and the sleek aesthetic of a lump of mineral.',
        'Of all of Rainbow Island\'s many oddities, radiant ore may be the most remarkable. Under a laser thermometer, its temperature reads over 100 degrees celsius, but it is cool to the touch and becomes an icy liquid when melted.\nThe mechanics behind its shifting array of pastel colors is easily understood once observed under a microscope: it\'s made up of infinitesimal deposits of pure rainbow.\nThen there\'s the way it gently vibrates, humming, as if radiating some strange cosmic energy. Spooky.'
    ],
    'sand': [
        'The finest, smoothest sand you\'ll ever see. Rubbish for sand castles.',
        'Silky Sand is what happens when the pressure of boring, regular sand, or also boring, regular rocks presses down on sand for centuries, resulting in a sand so smooth and pure it almost feels like water. These qualities make it very useful in gadget fabrication.'
    ],
    'snowflake': [
        'They made all other snowflakes feel jealous.',
        'Deep underground pressure sometimes forces droplets from the Slime Sea into freezing climates, turning them into snowflakes with an unusually consistent and beautiful quality to them. Slime scientists theorize that this is a natural side effect of the Slime Sea being made up of a perfect balance of all slimes.'
    ],
    'sunsap': [
        'So beautiful that staring at it too long will hurt your eyes.',
        'Despite its name, Sun sap is actually made of hardened amber whose strikingly golden hue is sure to brighten a rancher\'s day. Some say if you find one with a bug encased inside, it\'s even more valuable, but come on, it\'s a bug. What could you possibly do with that?'
    ],
    'wax': [
        'Can be used to make a great candle if you enjoy the smell of bee abdominal glands.',
        'Just like bees on Earth, bees on the Far, Far Range produce a waxy substance that they use to form their hives. Buzz wax is still malleable deposits of unused wax found in apiaries. It has many practical uses ranging from building materials to medicines. You can also chew it as the worst gum in the world.'
