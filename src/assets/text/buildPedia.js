    'corral': [
        'A happy slime makes for a happy rancher.',
        'A corral is used to keep slimes on a ranch. The open-air corrals are designed for maximum slime satisfaction, with the rich soil of the Range beneath them and its expansive sky above them. Slimes will remain perfectly happy within corrals as long as they are fed regularly. Remember: You can shoot things THROUGH a corral barrier. Handy! '
    ],
    'garden': [
        'Nothing beats the taste of food grown in your own backyard.',
        'The gardens used by ranchers use advanced technology to rapidly grow clones of fruits and veggies in a natural, though greatly sped up, way. By placing a sample into the replicator, the garden\'s soil is instantly populated by a fruit tree or veggie patch and will keep producing harvests until removed.'
    ],
    'coop': [
        'Keeping chickens in their place prevents the uprising.',
        'Though many ranchers simply let their chickens roam the ranch, a coop is the tool of a serious poultry producer. Coops keep hens and roostros close, allowing for maximum egg-laying potential. Just remember to avoid crowding the coop: chickens won\'t reproduce when in close proximity to more than a dozen other hens or roostros. But give them room and watch the love bloom.-'

    'pond': [
        'Water you going to do with this?',
        'A pond gives you a source of fresh water on the ranch that you can use for watering gardens, calming slimes in a corral, defeating tarr, or giving your puddle slimes a place to hang out and feed.'
    ],
    'incinerator': [
        'Don\'t need it? Burn it!',
        'An Incinerator will instantly burn anything it touches into ash, and then burn that ash into nothing. It\'s an excellent solution for eliminating a tarr outbreak or for simply disposing of unwanted slimes if you\'re a terrible, heartless monster.'
    ],
    'silos': [
        'You can\'t take it with you when you go, so put it in storage.',
        'A silo lets a rancher neatly store plorts and resources in a handy, compact unit. Simply shoot into an available silo port to fill it, or vac it to retrieve items within. Remember, a clean ranch is a happy ranch!'
