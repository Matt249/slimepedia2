# Slimepedia 2
A web equivalent of the Slimepedia in Slime Rancher 2 :)

# Runing locally
Dont forget to install packages first before running with `npm install`.

Then you can run the app with `npm start`, and will be accessible to `localhot:3000`. If anything Node will tell you what is the app's adress.
